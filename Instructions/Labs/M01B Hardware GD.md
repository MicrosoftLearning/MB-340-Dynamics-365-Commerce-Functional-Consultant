**Why learn this**? Retail stores cannot operate without peripheral devices.
Dynamics 365 Commerce consultants should be familiar with the different device
types found in stores, which devices are supported, and how they can be
configured.

**Scenario**: In this group discussion, you will review the peripheral’s found
in retail stores, understand how to identify supported scenarios and devices,
and the configuration requirements for Dynamics 365 Commerce.

**Time to complete**: 15 minutes

**Prerequisites**: None

**Objectives**: In this lab students will learn from each other’s experiences of
installing POS applications (Dynamics or others). This will help them frame the
different types of scenarios they may face as a Dynamics 365 Commerce
consultant. It also helps students to understand the questions they need to ask
to determine correct store topology.

### Exercise 1 – Device Types

As a group, discuss the different types of physical point-of-sale devices you
find in retail stores based on personal experiences.

Consider different types of retailers and how they may have different needs from
their POS devices. For example: Grocery, Fashion, Furniture and Hospitality.

### Exercise 2 – Peripheral Devices 

As a group, discuss the different types of peripheral devices often attached to
POS devices in retail stores. For example, thermal receipt printers.

If you have experience implementing these devices, share knowledge and
experience of complications and pain points, such as device software versioning
problems, issues using OPOS vs Windows drivers, Logo printing or security
issues.
