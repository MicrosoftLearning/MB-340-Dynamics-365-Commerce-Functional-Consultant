lab:
    title: 'B. Hands-on lab: Set up and test Distributed Order Management rules'
    module: 'Module 9: Manage order fulfillment and inventory in Dynamics 365 Commerce'
---


**Why learn this?** This activity takes the learnings from the activity ‘DOM
Scenarios, rules and examples’ and puts it into practice. Students will learn
how to configure distributed order management and see how the configuration is
used by the engine to allocate a fulfilment plan to an order.

**Scenario**: In this activity you will configure distributed order management
and test your configuration. This includes:

• Creating DOM rules

• Configuring a DOM fulfillment profile

• Setting inventory values to meet test requirements

• Creating test customer orders

• Configuring DOM processing

• Reviewing the results of DOM runs

**Time to complete**: 45 minutes

**Prerequisites**: None

**Objectives**: After completing this lab, students will have configured and
tested a realistic configuration of distributed order management. Combining the
set-up with a business scenario and validating the test results will help
students visualize the impact each configuration is having on the result.

### Exercises: 

Scenario – Fabrikam operates retail stores in the Unites States. The company
also has an online store and call center. Fabrikam has a central distribution
center.

When customers place orders, the company wants orders to be fulfilled from the
nearest available location where stock is available. To reduce freight costs,
orders must not be split to reduce freight costs.

Each store can process a maximum of one order per day due to low employee
numbers. An order must not leave a store short of inventory. A minimum of two
units of inventory for each item must be allocated to a store for walk-in
customers.

In the exercises that follow, you will configure distributed order management to
meet Fabrikam’s requirements. You will then complete a series of tests to
validate the configuration.

To test the configuration, you will create four new sales orders for customer
Mathew Tolley. Mathew lives in Alameda, San Francisco. The three Fabrikam
locations closest to Alameda, ordered by distance, are: The San Francisco store,
then the San Jose store, then the Central DC warehouse.

You will configure the following inventory availability:

| Item Number | San Francisco | San Jose | Central DC |
|-------------|---------------|----------|------------|
| 91065       | 10            | 5        | 1000       |
| 91066       | 0             | 10       | 800        |
| 91067       | 1             | 2        | 1200       |
| 91068       | 10            | 5        | 500        |

The four sales orders will be created with the following item lines:

-   Sales order 1 will have one item line, 91065.

-   Sales order 2 will have two item lines, 91065 and 91066.

-   Sales order 3 will have one item line, 91067

-   Sales order 4 will have one item line, 91068.

You will now run the DOM processing job.

The tables below demonstrate how each order will be evaluated:

| Order 1                                                                                                                                               | Meets partial order rule          | Meets minimum inventory rule | Meets maximum order rule | Location will be assigned |

| Central DC                                                                                                                                            | Nearest location already assigned |                              |                          |                           |
| Reason: San Francisco is the nearest location and meets all rules.                                                                                    |                                   |                              |                          |                           |

| Reason: San Francisco has no stock of item 91066 and orders cannot be split.                                                                          |                                   |                              |                          |                           |

| Central DC                                                                                                                                            | Yes                               | Yes                          | N/A                      | **Yes**                   |
| Reason: San Francisco and San Jose do not have enough inventory to meet the minimum required.                                                         |                                   |                              |                          |                           |

| San Francisco                                                                                                                                         | Yes                               | Yes                          | No                       | No                        |
| San Jose                                                                                                                                              | No                                | Yes                          | No                       | No                        |
| Central DC                                                                                                                                            | Yes                               | Yes                          | N/A                      | **Yes**                   |
| Reason: San Francisco and San Jose have both exceeded the maximum orders and Central DC is not a store, so does not apply to the maximum orders rule. |                                   |                              |                          |                           |

Finally, you will review the results of the DOM processing job, to validate the
orders have been assigned to the expected locations:

-   Order 1 – San Francisco

-   Order 2 – San Jose

-   Order 3 – Central DC

-   Order 4 – Central DC
